# A-Predictive-Model-for-Cardiovascular-Disease-Detection
## This project focused on predicting cardiovascular diseases using machine learning. We preprocessed the data to clean and organize it. After that, we built models like RandomForest and Logistic Regression to make predictions based on the data. The results show promising accuracy, emphasizing the potential for practical applications in healthcare.
